# 📚 AI Research Paper Intelligence System

An AI-powered research assistant that helps users discover, retrieve, summarize, compare, and analyze machine learning research papers using semantic search, large language models (LLMs), and vector databases.

## 🚀 Overview

The AI Research Paper Intelligence System enables users to search a large collection of machine learning research papers using natural language queries. Instead of relying on keyword matching, the system performs semantic similarity search using Sentence Transformers and FAISS to retrieve the most relevant papers.

The retrieved papers can then be summarized, compared, and analyzed using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated through LangChain.
